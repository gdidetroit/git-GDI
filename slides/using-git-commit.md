##  Using git commit

So far, we've created and then added a file to our repo. But it hasn't been commited yet. To commit the new file to your Git repo use the command

git commit -m “&lt;message&gt;”

<br>

```bash
$ git status
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
<br>

<p><blockquote>ProTip: I always like to check my status before I commit just to make sure I’m not committing something I don't want to. If you haven’t noticed, git status is a command you’ll use a lot.</blockquote></p>
