##  a word about snapshots

Git tracks changes by taking 'snapshots' of a project. You can think of this much like a snapshot in the real world.

When you change a file in a Git repo (and save it), it now differs from Git's snapshot. Git can now tell that there is a difference. But it only cares about the differences. Sort of like those 'Spot the difference' puzzles
